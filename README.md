# cpcontrib.video
Provides Video link parsing and embed/link rendering for popular video service providers

Library currently is broken down into parts: 
- a Video Link Parser that attempts to recognize links generated by video service companies
- tools to help render the video player for each service provider
- future: tools to interact with the service provider to obtain optimal video thumbnails/sizing

Video services supported: YouTube, Brightcove

# Quick Start

```c#
//post_save.aspx
  using CPContrib.Video;
  var videoService = new VideoService()
  var videoInfo = videoService.CreateParser().ParseLink(asset.Raw["provider_link"]);
  asset.SaveContentFields(videoService.new Dictionary<string,string> { { "provider", videoInfo.Company }, { "videoId", videoInfo.VideoId } });
//output.aspx
  var videoHtml = new VideoService().CreateVideoHtml(asset.Raw["provider"]);
  Out.Write(videoHtml.GetEmbed(
```

More integrations are desired and welcome: Vimeo, etc.
